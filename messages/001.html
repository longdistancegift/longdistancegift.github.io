            <p>This is the first picture I took of you. At first I was a little hesitant to tell people that I liked you, as I knew that there was a chance that I would never be with you. It wasn’t until this day, September 21st, that my cousin convinced me to send her a picture of you. By the way, the first thing she said after I sent her this picture was that you have beautiful hair. I know that you feel a bit self-conscious about your hair sometimes, but I want to reassure you that you don’t have to. It's beautiful and I love it, and even if you don’t see that yourself, other people do. After that day, I remember telling anyone who would listen about this girl I had a really big crush on. I’ve never felt like this with anyone else in my life, I could not get you out of my mind. Spending time with you, even just as friends, felt right. Every single day, I tried to find ways to be with you. From going out to eat with friends, to simply sitting by you at the library, your company always made my days better. I can spend all day just sitting next to you and not feel uncomfortable or awkward; spending time with you feels natural and effortless, it just feels right. After almost a year, I still have the biggest crush on you, and I always will. I can’t help but feel nervous when you’re around, I get excited everytime I get to see you, and everytime I hear your voice I feel at home.</p><br>
