            <p>I took this picture the night before my Astronomy midterm. I was dealing with a lot of issues, including procrastination and untreated OCD, that prevented me from getting anything done. I had to stay up late every day, doing what pretty much felt like a waste of time. I was extremely stressed out the night before the midterm, I had to learn everything in only one night. Right before you went to bed, you brought me a cup of coffee and a note that says “I love you”. This small gesture meant so much to me. For the first time in a very long time, I felt like I had someone else supporting me, and I knew that you would always be there for me when I needed you. I still have the note; I keep it in my wallet, and whenever I feel lonely or just need a little reminder, I look at it. This way I feel like you’re always with me. It doesn’t matter where we go, or how far away we are from each other, we’ll always have each other to rely on. You were also the first person that encouraged me to seek treatment for OCD. Before then, I had always been scared of taking medicine; I thought it would change me completely. But still, you encouraged me to give it a try. Thank you for always being there for me, especially when I need you the most. Remember that I love you, and that I’ll always be there to support you no matter what. We are a team, a family.</p><br>
